                <SectionBody>MHacks is a group of University of Michigan students who want to help you turn  your ideas into reality. We're best known for the 36-hour hackathons we run twice a year.  You're welcome to come with or without a team. We'll provide you with all the resources and  mentors you need to help you work on something cool or learn new skills. You'll have the freedom  to create a product, learn new techniques for your future work, or just have fun working on a project with friends. Moreover, we will offer you a chance to network with other creators and professionals. For newcomers and veterans alike, MHacks events are experiences you wonâ€™t want to miss.</SectionBody>
