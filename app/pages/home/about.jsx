                        MHacks is a 36-hour hackathon run by University of
                        Michigan students. At MHacks, we want to help you to
                        turn your ideas into reality. We’ll give you the
                        freedom, resources, and mentoring you need to do so and
                        in return we hope you’ll be as curious, productive, and
                        passionate as you can be. For newcomers and veterans
                        alike, MHacks is a weekend experience you won’t want to
                        miss.
